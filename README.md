# Minionify
An app that allows basic control over remote devices.

The users would be divided into 2 groups; managers and minions.
A manager can use the app to execute certain operations on the minions' devices, such as gathering statistics, sending notifications, determining location, opening another app etc.

The minions would use the app passively; by using the app, they willingly give the managers permission to execute operations on their devices.

Possible users of the app are worried parents with their children or strict bosses with their employees.
